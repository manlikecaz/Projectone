    <p>In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who explore fantasy worlds together as they embark
        on epic quests and level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is the game's referee and
        storyteller. There's no winning or losing in D&Dâ€”at least, not in the conventional way.</p>
    <p2>RPGs are a great way of exploring the world of legends, mythology, or folklore. They actively engage all
        participants. They are not only fun in the moment, but also create stories that players keep telling to each
        other often years after the game itself ended. From playing in a group lasting friendships can emerge, and
        through imaginary adventures real memories are born. The whole variety of oral tradition, from mythology to
        personal stories, is included in the gaming experience. Hello
